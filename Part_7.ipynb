    " - A loop is set up to run for 20 iterations. This loop represents the main execution block where both production and consumption of values will take place.\n",

    " - `produced = random.randint(0, 1)` simulates the action of generating sensor data by producing a random integer (0 or 1).\n",
    " - `print(f\"Produced: {produced}\")` displays the generated value, indicating that it has been 'produced'.\n",
    "4. Simulating the Consumer:\n",
    " - `gap = monitor.send(produced)` sends the produced value to the `monitor` generator, which processes this value by calculating the gap (number of zeros since the last one) and yields this gap back.\n",
    " - The gap value is then printed alongside the consumed value, indicating that the consumer has processed the value and determined the current gap.\n",
    "5. Repeat:\n",
    " - The loop continues, repeating this process of producing a random value and consuming it by calculating the gap. Each iteration represents a new cycle of production and consumption.\n",
    "6. End of Loop:\n",
    " - After 20 iterations, the loop ends. At this point, the program has simulated 20 cycles of producing and consuming sensor data."
